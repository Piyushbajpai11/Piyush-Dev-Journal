## ✅ What I Learned Today

### 🐧 Linux Deep Dive
- Completed a **5-hour Linux fundamentals** video – revisited and strengthened core Linux skills.
- Explored extensive **networking commands** and their practical use cases:
  - `ping`, `netstat`, `ifconfig`, `traceroute`, `tracepath`, `mtr`, `nslookup`, `telnet`
  - `hostname`, `ip`, `iwconfig`, `ss`, `arp`, `dig`, `whois`, `ifplugstatus`
  - `route`, `nmap`, `wget`, `watch`, `curl` (with `wget` comparison)

### 🛠️ Advanced Linux Commands
- Practiced powerful data-processing tools:
  - `awk` – pattern scanning and reporting
  - `sed` – stream editor for filtering and transforming text
  - `grep` – search text using patterns

### 🔧 Shell Scripting
- Began learning **shell scripting basics**:
  - Wrote small scripts with `if`, `for`, and variable usage
  - Understood the structure of bash scripts and file execution

### 🧮 DSA Practice
Solved 3 Data Structures and Algorithms problems:
1. 🔁 **Intersection of Sorted Arrays** – Optimized two-pointer approach
2. 🔄 **Palindrome String Check** – Case and non-alphanumeric handling
3. 🌲 **Symmetric Binary Tree** – Recursive tree traversal
